# State Persistence in React Scheduler

State persistence allowed Scheduler to retain the [`currentView`](../../api/schedule/currentview), [`selectedDate`](../../api/schedule/selecteddate) and Scroll position values in the [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) for state maintenance even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser. This action is handled through the [`enablePersistence`](../../api/schedule/enablepersistence) property which is set to false by default. When it is set to true, `currentView`, `selectedDate` and Scroll position values of the scheduler component will be retained even after refreshing the page.

> **Note**: Scheduler `id` is essential to set state persistence.

The following sample demonstrates how to set state persistence of the Scheduler component.

{% tab template="schedule/local-data", iframeHeight="588px", compileJsx=true %}

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {
  ScheduleComponent, Day, Week, WorkWeek, Month, Inject,
  ViewsDirective, ViewDirective} from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-schedule';
import { scheduleData } from './datasource';
import { extend } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';

class App extends React.Component<{}, {}>{
    private data: Object[] = extend([], scheduleData, null, true) as Object[];
    render() {
    return <ScheduleComponent  width= '100%' height='550px' selectedDate= {new Date(2018, 1, 15)} eventSettings= { { dataSource: this.data } } enablePersistence = { true }>
            <Inject services={[Day, Week, WorkWeek, Month]} />
        </ScheduleComponent>
    }
};
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('schedule'));
```

{% endtab %}
