# Validate image/* on drop

The uploader component allows you to upload all type of images by setting
**image/* ** to [allowedExtensions](../../api/uploader/#allowedextensions) property.

By default, the behavior is working with select a file using browse button. But, this behavior doesnâ€™t support
on drag and drop the files. You can handle this behavior manually using `selected` event by filtering the file types from application.

In the following example, validated image files using images/*. You are able to drag and drop the image files with extension of PNG, JPG, BPG, GIF and TIFF to upload it.
