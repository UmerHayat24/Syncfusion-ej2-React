# Sidebar with fixed position

The Sidebar does not require any specific style to make it as a fixed one. By default, the Sidebar position will be in fixed state. The following example demonstrates that the Sidebar is rendered with a fixed position. The position of the Sidebar will not change when scrolling the main content area.

{% tab template="sidebar/fixed-position", sourceFiles="app/App.tsx,app/index.tsx,index.html,style.css",  compileJsx=true %}

{% endtab %}
