# State Persistence

State persistence refers to the TreeGrid's state maintained in the browser's [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser.

State persistence stores treegrid’s model object in the local storage when the [`enablePersistence`](../api/treegrid/#enablepersistence) is defined as true.

## Get or set localStorage value

If the [`enablePersistence`](../api/treegrid/#enablepersistence) property is set to true, the treegrid property value is saved in the **window.localStorage** for reference. You can get/set the localStorage value by using the **getItem/setItem** method in the **window.localStorage**.

```typescript

        // get the TreeGrid model.
        const value: string = window.localStorage.getItem('treegridTreeGrid') as string;
        // "treegridTreeGrid" is component name + component id.
        const model: object = JSON.parse(value);

```

```typescript

        // set the TreeGrid model.
        // "treegridTreeGrid" is component name + component id.
        window.localStorage.setItem('treegridTreeGrid', JSON.stringify(model));

```
